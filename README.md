# coding-challenges

I am (unfortunately) notorious at bombing under the stress and bright lights of live coding interviews. Even when that happens, I still insist on taking the problem home and solving it on my own time.

This is intended to be a growing collection of smallish solutions from the prior interviews, or that I simply wanted
to challenge myself with.
